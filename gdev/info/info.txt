
1.Change directory to %WXWIN%\build\msw and type
 > nmake /f makefile.vc


to build wxWidgets in the default debug configuration as a static library. You can also do
 > nmake /f makefile.vc BUILD=release


to build a release version or
 > nmake /f makefile.vc BUILD=release SHARED=1


to build a release DLL version. Finally, you can also add "TARGET_CPU=X64" to nmake command line to build Win64 versions (this only works if you are using a 64 bit compiler, of course).

See "Configuring the Build" for more information about the additional parameters that can be specified on the command line.


2.To verify your build, change the directory to %WXWIN%\samples\minimal and run the same nmake command (with the same parameters there), this should create a working minimal wxWidgets sample.


3.If you need to rebuild, use "clean" target first or "nmake /a".
